General email ideas and concepts -- pick one!



Have you been impacted by COVID-19 shutdowns?  Job loss, death of family members or friends?  Grab your FREE copy of "Infectious Disease Protocol-8020", then contact your local health agency and let them know what you think.  Put a fire under their heels!

Heed the Call-to-Arms and warn our neighbors to take up the call and defend our lives, our families and our liberty.

So you've decided to grab your pitch fork and defend yourselves against the onslaught of infectious diseases.  Welcome to the party!

Governments handling of COVID-19 is like a lumbering Giant with a Club trying to swat a mosquito.  They will eventually hit the thing; but along the way they will uproot and destroy the forest.

Hi,
My name is Kevin Heber.  You probably don't know me, I probably don't know you.
If you received this email, someone who knows you believes your health is important enough to pass it along.

COVID-19 has prompted me to organize some ideas that may help solve challenges associated with Infectious Diseases.
If you would like to help in developing global awareness, please join me by visiting my site and sharing this email with your family and friends.

First: grab a copy of the protocol   http://www.protocol-8020.info  { For your safety, you must copy and paste the web address in a new tab }
Second: read over Protocol-8020 so you have a basic idea of the battle plan.
Third: ring the bells, sound the alarms and light the signal fires -- tell your neighbors so they can help too. { follow instructions for forwarding email }
Fourth: don't wait - contact your government's officials and motivate them to take action.
Fifth: take charge of your personal risk matrix. { software to be developed }

As Spock says: Live long and prosper
