<p>
<b>Introduction:</b>  Protocol-8020 is an iterative solution to several of the challenges related to disease control, mitigation and eradication.<br>
The 80-20 rule <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" class="https">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle</a> provides the theoretical basis for this protocol.  Ie: that we can expend 20% of the resources to solve 80% of the problem.  Then iterate again to solve the next 16%.  Total solution set is 96% while resources consumed is ~40%.
</p>

<p>
<b>Purpose:</b>  To provide an alternative paradigm to manage infectious and other diseases.
</p>

<p>
There are 4 primary concepts that form the basis of <b>Protocol-8020</b>:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Containment</li>
<li>Profile the disease</li>
<li>Profile the population</li>
<li>Develop &amp; apply iterative solutions</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Discussion:</b>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Containment - full containment until the disease profile is derived, without which the safety of releasing people from containment cannot be determined.</li>
<li>Profile the disease - create a disease profile and make it public and freely available</li>
<li>Profile the population - software program that is local and which has a natural persons' medical history</li>
<li>Develop and apply iterative solutions - a combination of research and logistical solutions to develop an immunization program, manufacture, storage, deployment and provisioning to the public in a cost effective and iterative manner.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>Expanded discussion:</b>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Containment - is a medical and logistical challenge for which working solutions are already known; though not applied consistently and persistenly, resulting in containment failure.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
topics 2, 3, and 4 are interrelated and will be discussed together.
</p>

<p>
As an iterative solution, partial solutions can be represented by both the iterative cycle and by the effective rate.  This means that we do not need full immunization effectiveness at each cycle when partial solutions accumulate, since we can iterate again.  This is represented by innoculations which have a cumulative effect and where multiple innoculations can be applied.  For example:  The first iteration across the 80% group may only provide 35% effective immunization.  People exposed to the disease will still get sick, but the peaks of the disease will be moderated because the immune system has been primed. [Insert charts showing hypothetical disease growth vs immune response level]
</p>

<p>
Because <b>Protocol-8020</b> is represented as in iterative solution, it is only necessary to solve until the effective solution satisfies our criteria, at which point we stop.  For example, solving PI to 4 decimal places is sufficient for many applications and there is no additional benefit derived from further iterations.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Examples of solving the 4% problem first:<br>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Case 1</b> -- <i>Flu Vaccine</i>
</div>
The Flu vaccine is an example of the poor results that occure when the 4% solution is solved without solving and applying the 80% and 16% solutions first.  Amongst the 4% of those receiving the Flu shot, approximately 85% of these have low to no benefit.  So the effective solution is about 0.6% of the population.
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Case 2</b> -- <i>COVID-19</i>
</div>
COVID-19 is an example of the consequences caused by a partial solution to the 4% and applying it(containment) across the whole of the population.  Maximizes the cost(damage).
</p>

<br>

<p>
An example of how Protocol-8020 is expected to work in practice.
</p>

<p>
The population is divided up into Ocean and Islands.  The Ocean is the 96% solution set, the Islands represent the 4% solution set.
</p>

<p>
Solving only the 4% -- Flu Vaccine is represented as an Ocean of active viral infections with Islands of High Risk - some of which have been vaccinated.  Viral elements are able to traverse the Ocean and have variable length mutation paths.  Because the flu vaccine is locked to a particular strain, as the viral elements traverse the ocean they mutate, with each mutation reducing the effectiveness of the vaccine.
</p>

<p>
Solving the 80% -- Now take the same general scenario and solve the 80% &amp; 16% problems and apply the solutions. The Ocean is no longer an active breeding ground for the viral element.  The Ocean now provides a natural immunization barrier to the traversal of the viral elements.  The length of the mutation chains is dramatically reduced.  Even if the 4% solution is unsolvable, the natural immunization barrier provides an effective solution to the 4% problem by isolating the Islands from each other.  As long as there is no carrier that transports the viral element from one Island to another, there is no disease spread.  And if the disease cannot spread, and there is no environmental reservoir, the disease is extinguished.
</p>

<p>
As evidenced by Influenza(Flu) and COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.  If the Ocean is not immunized, the disease cannot be contained, even though the rate of spread may be reduced.
</p>

<p>
Containment of a disease to an Island is easier to achieve and maintain if the surrounding Ocean is immunized.
</p>

<br>

<p>
------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
<b>Critical Path:</b>
</p>

<p>
Profile the global population.  Profile known diseases.  Build the risk matrix.  Develop and deploy iterative solutions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Definitions:</b><br>
nominal -- innoculation has no significant effect<br>
Minimum Effective -- innoculation has a cumulative beneficial effect<br>
Maximum Safe -- innoculation has a cumulative effect, but risks full disease expression above this level
</p>

<p>
Target is for each iteration of the innoculation to be close to minimum effective.  It is considered better to have several minimum effective rather than few max safe.  Because of statistical variations, innoculation at minimum effective will have some below.  So, min effect + ~15% may produce the optimum.
</p>

<p>
These values are computed for each iteration.  Instead of solving for these values for the whole population, ie: effectively solving the 4% problem, we can solve for these values for each iteration, which is a lower cost solution.
</p>

<br>

<p>
Part of the challenge is partitioning the population.  We need a consistent and reliable way to determine for each natural person, which group they are in.  Groupings will change over time, so a medical profile questionaire becomes necessary.  This information does not have to be centrally stored, but each person should have answered the questionaire, summed the risk factors and be able to determine which iteration they should participate in.  Because of the iterative nature, during an outbreak, the questionaire can be updated with new risk factors and their values.  Easy to do with a downloadable file, print, fill it out, sum the values, determine iteration to participate in.  The file could also be available as a spreadsheet that does the grunt work as we mark our risk factors.  This preserves privacy, allows a more complete set of factors to be evaluated, reduces errors.
</p>

<p>
For existing diseases there is generally sufficient information to build the profile.  For new diseases, a profile will have to be built up as we learn.<br>
For the population -- it becomes practical to move away from a spreadsheet to a downloadable program that stores a medical profile locally and downloads disease profiles from the CDC or other recognized source.  This allow us to create a local medical profile for each member of the household by entering information only once.  Then view our risk factors associated with each disease profile and make more informed decisions about how to manage our own innoculation activities.
</p>

<p>
The program is local, it must preserve privacy and confidentiality of the personal profile.<br>
For the purpose of building management solutions, the summation of risk for each disease profile can be voluntarily(opt-in) uploaded.  This can be used to perform large data analysis and develop deployment schedules for each iteration.  A website can be available which shows the dispersal of risk factors for public view.
</p>

<p>
Part of the foundational concepts is to involve the public in helping to manage infectious diseases by providing them with useful, relevent information and resources that are personalized.
</p>

<p>
It becomes helpful to have several categories of risk such as; the risk of exposure, the risk of disease expression if exposed, risk of different types of exposure, risk of serious complications or death, etc.  Some of theses categories are designed to help organize the population groups, others will show social behavioral risks.  As more people enter their own profiles and voluntarily upload their summerized risk values; we can build better models.
</p>

<p>
Profile values are many; such as -- age, weight, height, gender, ethnicity, location, nationality, marriage status, sexual activity, social interaction (work, play, party, etc), food (meat, fish, vegan, vegetarian), medical history (current &amp; prior diseases), inherited disease risks, smoking, drug use, BMI, physical activity level, etc.  So long as the data is kept local and private, people can enter as little or as much as they want.
</p>

<p>
Disease profiles are built iteratively.  Basic profile might be copied from similar disease strains, then improved as data comes in from the global community.
</p>

<p>
In discussing the software, with enough personal profile points, the software can also include risk profiles for acquired diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cancer, etc.  USA and Europe have privacy policies for medical data that makes it prohibitive to centralize the storage of individual profiles.  These must be stored locally.
</p>

<p>
There will be a strong incentive for non-official websites to offer web storage -- plus advertising.  These will seem convenient, but pose a huge privacy risk.
</p>

<p>
Any data feedback is a privacy risk.  Once enough diseases have been locally profiled and individuals upload the summary stats, the individuals stats can be solved by x equations of y unknowns.  It is important to inform the person of this information leak.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about the software.  The source code must be available for review and improvement.  IE: opensource, BSD or public domain type license.<br>
It should be multi-platform, have a clean GUI, etc.  Possibly option to password protect each persons profile.   Possible for desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone versions.<br>
Profiles must be in a cross-platform text only format.<br>
Software features:  copy a profile and experiment with changing values to view different risk scenarios.<br>
Each risk factor also has a weighted value; how much the risk should count of the total.
</p>

<p>
Disease profiles will need several datapoints to describe the disease risk factors as a curve vs the user profile.  For example: AGE(individual, fixed point) vs AGE related disease risk(curve).
</p>

<p>
------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
How we measure and quantify the spread of the disease impacts how we and the public perceive the disease.  Using terms such as (used in COVID-19) and then changing the terms for those who receive innoculations(these people would now TEST positive -- so should be reported as such).  Pick terms and stick with them.  Don't use infammatory terms to spread FUD(fear, uncertainty and doubt) then swap terms later.
</p>

<p>
Categories should be chosen for their long-term value; not short term impact.<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Hospitalized due to Disease</li>
</ol>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
1a. fully recovered<br>
1b. died<br>
1c. long-term side effects
</div>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Tested positive, no hospitalization - died or long-term effects</li>
<li>Tested positive, but required no medical care</li>
<li>tested positive due to innoculation</li>
<li>other</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
There is a need for more precision in the descriptive conditions.  Plots corresponding to the above outcomes should show: disease progression, immune response, side effects, etc.
</p>

<p>
There are strong incentives for organizations to sensationalize.  Slapping bulk labels on disparate categories provides ample opportunity for FUD by the media and other organizations.  More funding is provided to medical institutions when the data looks bleak. Ie: even CDC and other groups have an incentive to sensationalize.
</p>

<p>
------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
Having a personal profile with a matrix of disease risks locally accessible moves the "action point" from the medical professional to the person who needs it most, and who can then make informed decisions about what life changes to make to reduce the risk factors.<br>
This also removes the "pay wall" of going to the doctor to get one's personal medical info.  It should available at no cost from the medical source (doctor, hospital, etc) and be importable into the program.<br>
The concept that we need a doctor visit to "interpret" the information is a "false premise".  Properly designed personal profiles and disease profiles will produce useful results, provide for an informed patient, and help open discussions between patient and care giver so that the best solutions can be used.
</p>

<p>
There is the "discrimination" risk for insurance and employment -- that a completed personal profile becomes a basis for insurance risk pricing and job hiring/firing.  Solving this is a social, legislative and legal problem not directly part of this discussion.<br>
Because of these risks, an individuals' health information; instead of being readily available to act on, is treated as a Trade Secret and protections put in place to prevent exposure of the information.  Which also means, it's not available to use when, where and how it's most often needed.
</p>

<p>
------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
A specific goal of <b>Protocol-8020</b> is to increase the global immunization level for each infectious disease - over time.  That those at low risk will get immunized so that later, when they move to a higher risk category, they carry the immunization with them.  Even common cold can be mitigated through this process.  Immunization of each mutation(strain) of the common cold will increase global immune level, decrease mutation rate and transmission rate.
</p>

<p>
Implementing and applying an innoculation solution is primarily a logistical problem for which there are many solutions.
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>One of the solutions which I have considered is to use LIVE virus to innoculate the 80%.  The 80% are those who, when exposed to the viral element, will develop an immune response at very low risk of death or disability from the disease.  We can observe that for both the Flu and COVID-19, a large (80%) of the population does not suffer ill effects from exposure.  Determining this 80% portion of the population is the driving factor behind Profiling the Population and Profiling the Disease.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>For viral elements that prefer traversal and infection as aerosols (flu, COVID-19, many others), it becomes useful to determine how exposure to the disease with LIVE virus can be provided at lowest risk.  I propose a dermal route of introducing the virus, similiar to the Tine Test for Tuberculosis.  This will introduce the viral element in an area of the body where it is at a disadvantage.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Dermal application provides many advantages:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Lower risk of full disease expression.</li>
<li>Reduced cost of innoculation - For example, the flu vaccine is provided at a higher cost because it's an injection, while the cost estimate in bulk of a 4 pin dermal innoculation could be done for less than $2.</li>
<li>Because the body has the advantage, it can contain the disease and then mount a more effective immune response.  This reduces the disease expression and shortens the disease active time.</li>
<li>Reduces the risk of passing the disease along through aerosol (coughing and sneezing).  Easier to bandage an arm than a lung.</li>
<li>Can be manufactured in bulk, promptly shipped to location of use, then used for large groups.  These groups can be isoloated in bulk (stadiums, schools, etc) or stay at home during the following active time.</li>
<li>Because the time of exposure is known, the natural person, caregivers and medical personel can monitor and more accurtely read the symptoms to determine if the disease is not contained and the risk of full expression is at hand.</li>
<li>Timely medical care and isolation from higher risk groups during the disease active time.</li>
<li>Because the time of exposure is known, use of immune enhancing foods and supplements can be taken; giving the body more advantages.  This could be as simple as taking a small Vitamin C tablet each day for 2-3 weeks after the innoculation.</li>

** An important concept here is that - for the 80% population group - exposure to the disease is not life threatening.  It is advantageous to be exposed as early as possible, to know the time of exposure, and to be actively involved.  Once exposed, the bodies defenses will be activated and the bulk of the population is now Immunized at low risk and low cost.<br>
** Second important concept to grasp is that the different groups may/will have different solutions.  What works for the 80% may not be the choice for the 16% or the 4%.  The implicit goal of Protocol-8020 is to leverage this; to quickly solve the 80% problem while developing solutions for the 16% and 4%.

<b>Conclusion:</b>
</p>

<p>
The 8020 in the title of this protocol is a constant reminder to solve the infectious disease problem by applying an iterative process.  A problem that seems intractable can often be partially solved if we can partition the problem.  Partitioning the problem and animating the whole of the world's population through information dispersal, private and public discourse, and active participation by people in their own health care will surely improve the global health.

 <b>Foundations for Research:</b>
</p>

<p>
Along with the factors associated with the Disease Profile and Personal Profile, here are four(4) readily available independent variables:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>The time of exposure to the disease.</li>
<li>The intensity of exposure.</li>
<li>The location of exposure.</li>
<li>Type and amount of immune enhancing supplements.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Part of the effectiveness of <b>Protocol-8020</b> derives from controlling these independent variables.
</p>

<p>
Because we know the time of exposure, we can take action by:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Taking temperature readings (every 2 or 4 hours or so) and entering it into the software (profile matrix - risk) and letting the software raise alerts based on the available profiles.</li>
<li>Provide immune enhancing supplements</li>
<li>Take prompt corrective action on profile alert</li>
<li>Build a more precise disease profile (progression) for stats voluntarily uploaded.  The improved disease profile will then available for download to improve the matrix.</li>
</ol>
